# Configuration Notes
# ===================
#
# Token Budget Guidelines:
# - Minimal (no skills):     ~3,000 tokens
# - Light (1 skill):         ~7,000 tokens
# - Standard (2-3 skills):   ~10,000-13,000 tokens
# - Advanced (3-4 skills):   ~13,000-17,000 tokens
# - Maximum (5+ skills):     ~17,000-25,000 tokens
#
# Recommendations:
# - Start with minimal configuration
# - Add skills incrementally based on actual needs
# - Monitor context usage in production
# - Remove unused skills after 5+ sessions
# - Aim for 2-4 skills per agent in production
#
# Skill Selection Strategy:
# 1. Identify primary agent function
# 2. Add PRIMARY skill for core capability
# 3. Add SECONDARY skills for common tasks
# 4. Test and measure actual skill usage
# 5. Remove skills with < 10% usage rate
