# Skill: Web Artifacts Builder

## Purpose
Build interactive web artifacts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for demonstrations, prototypes, and user interfaces.

## Capabilities
- Create single-file HTML artifacts with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Build interactive demos and visualizations
- Generate UI mockups and prototypes
- Create data visualizations using D3.js, Chart.js, or similar libraries

## Best Practices
1. Keep artifacts self-contained in a single HTML file
2. Use modern, semantic HTML5
3. Include responsive design principles
4. Add clear comments explaining key sections
5. Test across different browsers when possible

## Usage Guidelines
- Use this skill when the user requests a visual demonstration
- Prefer artifacts over code blocks for interactive content
- Include clear instructions on how to use the artifact
- Consider accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

## Example Use Cases
- Interactive dashboards
- Data visualization demos
- UI component prototypes
- Form builders and validators
- Animation demonstrations
