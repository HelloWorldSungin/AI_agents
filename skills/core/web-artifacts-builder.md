<objective>
Build interactive web artifacts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for demonstrations, prototypes, and user interfaces. Create single-file HTML artifacts with embedded CSS and JavaScript, interactive demos, visualizations, UI mockups, and prototypes.
</objective>

<quick_start>
When the user requests a visual demonstration or interactive content:
1. Create a self-contained single HTML file
2. Use modern, semantic HTML5 structure
3. Embed CSS and JavaScript directly in the file
4. Include responsive design principles
5. Add clear comments explaining key sections
</quick_start>

<workflow>
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify what type of artifact is needed (dashboard, visualization, UI component, etc.)
2. **Plan Structure**: Design the HTML structure with semantic elements
3. **Build Content**: Create the HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript
4. **Add Interactivity**: Implement JavaScript functionality for interactive features
5. **Test & Refine**: Ensure the artifact works as expected and is responsive
6. **Document Usage**: Include clear instructions on how to use the artifact
</workflow>

<examples>
**Use Cases**:
- Interactive dashboards
- Data visualization demos using D3.js, Chart.js, or similar libraries
- UI component prototypes
- Form builders and validators
- Animation demonstrations

**Best Practices**:
- Keep artifacts self-contained in a single HTML file
- Consider accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Test across different browsers when possible
- Prefer artifacts over code blocks for interactive content
</examples>

<success_criteria>
- Artifact is self-contained in a single HTML file
- All CSS and JavaScript are embedded (no external dependencies unless necessary)
- The artifact is interactive and functional
- Code includes clear comments
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Instructions are provided for using the artifact
</success_criteria>
