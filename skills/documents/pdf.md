<objective>
Analyze, extract, and summarize information from PDF documents. Extract text content, identify document structure (headings, sections, tables), summarize long documents, extract specific information (dates, names, figures), and compare multiple PDF documents.
</objective>

<quick_start>
When analyzing a PDF document:
1. Verify PDF is readable (not image-based or encrypted)
2. Identify document type first (report, contract, manual, etc.)
3. Perform initial scan to understand length and structure
4. Note page numbers when referencing content
5. Preserve important formatting and structure
</quick_start>

<workflow>
1. **Initial Scan**: Identify document type, length, and structure
2. **Content Extraction**: Extract relevant text and data
3. **Organization**: Structure information logically
4. **Summarization**: Create concise summaries as needed
5. **Verification**: Check for completeness and accuracy
6. **Flag Issues**: Note any unclear or ambiguous sections
</workflow>

<examples>
**Summary Format**:
```
**Document**: [Title]
**Type**: [Report/Contract/Manual/etc.]
**Pages**: [X]
**Date**: [Document date if available]

**Key Points**:
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

**Detailed Sections**:
1. Section 1: [Summary]
2. Section 2: [Summary]
```

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Ask clarifying questions if document purpose is unclear
- Provide page references for important information
- Note any limitations (poor quality, partial extraction, etc.)
- Offer to dive deeper into specific sections
</examples>
